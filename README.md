# OBv2.0

OB v.2 is an artificial intelligence artist project. * Color, value, texture, stain, which are design elements belonging to the artist(Özgür Ballı), * The artist's design principles such as integrity, difference, balance, contrast, emphasis, rhythm, * Belonging to the artist, such as muscle memory, handprint, brush stain, search for original form; It is an artificial intelligence artist algorithm that has the potential to be a copy of the artist who produces with the use of data created over a period of about 2 years on personal and original principles, and more. In summary; The possibilities and practices brought about by the digitalized culture are inevitably evolving to be used in artistic spaces. Thanks to these new possibilities, the works that blur the boundaries between art, science and philosophy expand our traditional ideas, understandings and even our perceptions about the world, and easily lead us to the idea that a new construction and exciting new breathing process has begun in art.
